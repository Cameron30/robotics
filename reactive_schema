  Our reactive approach followed along the lines of the subsumption architecture of Brooks. It did this , in that the our code has layers between which global variables communicate with one another in order to process and react to data. One example of this is in the use of the bumper node to control the escape behavior. If the bumper node changes its state to PRESSED, on any of the three bumpers, this data is then used to command the motor to back the robot away from the object. According to the data the robot will move smartly in another direction and continue its execution of autonomus movement.
